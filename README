TIMEKEEPER
An accurate Timekeeper in AS3 and a solution to the problem of isochronism in the Flash Player

PROBLEM:
Both 'onEnterFrame' and 'Timer' events have variable periodicity and cannot be relied upon to keep reliable time.

SOLUTION:
The timekeeper works by keeping a very fast internal regulator to update a slower user clock.
Periodic accuracy is achieved by referencing the system clock and maintaining an accumulator.

FEATURES:
* Stop and start the timekeeper.
* Get and set the time (in milliseconds).
* Get and set the tickFrequency. Default = every 1 second.
* Get and set the tickDuration. Default = 1 second.

LIMITATIONS:
* tickDuration values smaller than one second will work but are not recommended.
* For capacity reasons the datatype for both '_time' and '_tickDuration' is Number.
* For speed reasons the datatype for '_time' is Number, rather than a Date.
* Conversion to Date is really simple: var d = new Date(time).
